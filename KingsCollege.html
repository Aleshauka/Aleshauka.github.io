			<article>Our diversity drives our excellence. We come from all around the world, with a range of backgrounds, characteristics, lifestyles, experiences, perspectives, talents and ideas. This is what makes Kingâ€™s a fascinating and rewarding place to work and study, and a world-leading university.

All UK HEI employers are responsible for advancing equal opportunity for all and protecting employees from discrimination and harassment. Collecting data on aspects of our identity which make us unique, such as our gender, ethnicity and sexual orientation, are protected by equality legislation (The Equality Act 200) and enables us to monitor the diversity of those we employ. Practically, it also ensures that our systems and processes promote equity of opportunity and support zero tolerance towards bullying, harassment and victimisation. This is called Equal Opportunity data.</article>
